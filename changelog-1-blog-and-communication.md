We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new blog system and several communication enhancements that make it easier to stay informed and engaged with the community.

### 🧩 Blog System

Our new blog section is now live! You can find it in the main navigation, featuring two types of content:

- **Guidelines**: Official community guidelines and best practices
- **Change Logs**: Regular updates about new features and improvements

The blog supports rich content formatting, media attachments, and interactive comments. All authenticated users can comment on posts, and we've added an emoji picker to make your comments more expressive.

### ⚙️ Enhanced Comments

We've significantly improved the commenting experience:

- **Emoji Picker**: Express yourself with emojis directly in comments
- **Better Error Handling**: More reliable comment creation with improved error messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments appear immediately after posting

### 🐞 Notification System

A comprehensive notification system has been implemented to keep you informed:

- **Unread Badge**: See your unread notification count in the header
- **Notification Page**: Dedicated page to view all your notifications
- **Smart Filtering**: Notifications are intelligently filtered to show only relevant updates

These improvements make it easier to stay connected with the community and never miss important updates. We're continuously working on enhancing your experience, so stay tuned for more updates!
